# model for a chatbot
Chatbot model trained on a small dataset with tensorflow keras

The dataset contains some simple medical training input and possible responses. The main part of this project is data preparation, parsing and vectorization with numpy. The size of dataset restricts it's usage to only the narrow medical topics but it's a great template for future works
 
To develop it I'll need to expand my knowledge on natural language processing and find a better dataset
