# multinomial logistic regression
This project was based on assignment from 'elements of statistical machine learning' from from the 4th semester of my computer science studies

It focuses on multinomial logistic regression. It implements such tools as softmax function, cross entropy, gradient for cross entropy, classification. All to create a model for recognizing hand written numbers from famous MNIST dataset
