# word frequency experiment
A project about word occurences in text. The analysis regards the number of different words, number of their occurences, their length etc.

At the moment it's goal to find the distribution(and it's parameters) of quantity of words of certain length in the text. The main aim of this project is to experiment with language data, entertain the programmer(me) and hopefully find something interesting

The project uses english translation of bible as an example text
