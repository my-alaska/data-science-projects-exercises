# data-science-exercises
This repository is my playground for smaller data science projects in python(usually with numpy and/or pandas). I might develop it into something bigger but as for now it's a good exercise. It uses Python3 with .ipynb notebook files

Each directory contains separate project/exercise and readme file describing it
